Hi <%= @contact.full_name.present? ? @contact.full_name : @contact.business_name %>,
<br>
<br>
Just a friendly reminder, we have yet to receive payment of <%= format_money @invoice.outstanding %> in respect of our invoice #<%= @invoice.invoice_number %>, which was due for payment on <%= @invoice.issue_date.strftime(t('date.common')) %>. This invoice is now <%= (Date.current - @invoice.issue_date).to_i %> days overdue.
<br>
Please let us know when payment will be made as a matter of urgency. Please ignore this email if you've recently paid for this invoice.
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
